https://github.com/jaspervdj/patat

Built the patat binary for Mac on OSX Mojave 10.14.5.
It could possibly work with earlier versions but unsure.

Place binary in path:
[Releases](https://github.com/kodaman2/patat-mac/releases)
```
$HOME/.local/bin
```

Add line to .bash_profile:
```
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```
